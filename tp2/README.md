## Project information
- Scene
  - We've decided to build on top of the existing scene, created for the 1st assignment.
  - The scene consists of a public pool, with some caveats.
  - [Link to the scene file](scenes/sgi_tp2_T03_G10.xml)
- Animations
  - [A person kicks a football into the pool after a trip to the bar](#person-kicking-the-ball-into-the-pool)
  - [A person jumps to the pool from a board](#person-jumping-into-the-pool)
  - [Waving flag](#waving-flag)
- Shaders
  - Water shader can be visualized at [this animation](#person-jumping-into-the-pool)
- Other
  - Replaced walls with retangle patch to improve visibility.
  - Added a tv inside the bar

## Issues/Problems

- At the beggining, we had some issues understanding what was being asked relative to the shader part of the assignment, but, after talks with the teacher and monitor, everything was cleared up.
- Had some difficulties building the Barrel.

Even though it was not asked, we decided to include some videos demostrating the created animations, since screenshots won't don't do them justice.
